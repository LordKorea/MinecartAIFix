# Minecart AI Fix

A minecraft mod designed to fix bug
[MC-64836](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fbugs.mojang.com%252fbrowse%252fMC-64836)

This bug enables entities other than players to use their AI while in minecarts
which might break automation designs and other contraptions using minecarts.

The fix provided disables steering of minecarts by entities other than players
and might cause problems with other mods relying on the default minecart
mechanics.

This mod requires Forge. It was tested with build #2259 for 1.11.2 and
build #2623 for 1.12.2.
